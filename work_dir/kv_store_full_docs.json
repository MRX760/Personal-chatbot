Introduction\n\n1.1 Purpose\n\nCreating test case to identify defect on system with new-feature before release\n\nDefining list of test deliverables\n\nIdentifying software components to be tested\n\n1.2 Scope\n\n1.2.1 Scope of driver part\n\nThe following components of mobile software functionality will be tested:\n\nDrag-and-drop feature\n\nOrder list feature\n\nUpdate order list feature\n\nConfirmation of delivery stops after changing/updating order list\n\n1.2.1 Scope of driver part\n\nThe following components of Warehouse Management System software will be tested:\n\nWarehouse notification feature\n\n1.3 Objectives\n\nThe testing objective is to ensure that the new feature does not create defects in existing features and that it functions precisely as defined in the requirements document.\n\n1.4 References\n\nTest plans are using following references:\n\nSoftware QA Tester Project Test (product requirements document)\n\nUse cases of driver and warehouse analyst\n\nTestrail \n\nRegression testing suites\n\n2. Test Items\n\nFollowing items will be tested based on existing version of software:\n\nReal-time notification system\n\nDelivery order distribution\n\nMobile App: delivery process\n\nLegacy feature for regression testing\n\n3. Feature to be tested\n\nFollowing test items will be tested based on PRD, with additional regression test to ensure existing feature functionality, performance test, and usability testing for user experience.\n\nFeature functionality specific test (Based on PRD):\n\nUpdate delivery order list by driver via mobile app\nTest verifies that driver can update order list via mobile app and see updated order list without waiting for confirmation or delay.\n\n\n\nNotification received by warehouse management system from driver mobile app\nTest verifies that warehouse management system can receive notification of updated list.\n\n\n\nDelivery confirmation on updated order list\nTest verifies that driver can send an accurate confirmation data to warehouse management system after updating order list via mobile app.\n\n\n\nEnd-to-end test with update order list feature\nTest verifies that driver can execute usual business flow by using new drag-and-drop feature to update order list.\n\n\n\nRegression test:\n\nDistribution of order list created by analyst via back end to driver mobile app\nEnsuring the analyst could send order list to driver app via back-end system.\n\n\n\nNotification received by warehouse management system from driver mobile app\nEnsuring warehouse management system receive notification from driver app when driver update the order list and confirming completed delivery.\n\n\n\nList of original delivery order inside driver mobile app\nEnsuring driver can see original order list sent by analyst.\n\n\n\nDelivery confirmation on updated order list\nEnsuring driver can confirm completed delivery on updated order list.\n\n\n\nDelivery confirmation on original order list from analyst\nEnsuring the driver can confirm completed delivery on original order list from analyst\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd-to-end test without update order list feature\nEnsuring the system and both user (analyst and driver) can do usual business flow without using new drag-and-drop feature to update order list.\n\n\n\nEnd-to-end test with update order list feature\nEnsuring the system and both user (analyst and driver) can do usual business flow with using new drag-and-drop feature to update order list.\n\n\n\nUsability test:\n\nDrag-and-drop feature ease of use on driver mobile app\nEvaluates how intuitive and user-friendly the feature on mobile app for various driver age (assumption that age influence the tech savviness)\n\n\n\nUI feedback for updating the order list and error handling\nEvaluates how communicative the UI when giving feedback to driver after updating the order list and handling error (e.g signal lost after drag-and-drop) \n\n\n\nError recovery \nEvaluates how effective the UI and system to be recovered from user mistakes (e.g accidental drag-and-drop)\n\n4. Features Not to be Tested\n\nSome legacy features will not be tested by user and manual QA engineer, such as:\n\nLogin\n\nCreate order by analyst\n\nSorting stops for order list by analyst\n\nBack-end related test (no details provided in the requirement document)\n\nThese features will not interfere with the new feature, however these features will consist inside regression testing in end-to-end test.  Back end related test also not going to be executed since the requirement document didn’t specifies any of back-end systems, so we are working on assumption that the back-end working well or covered by other team.\n\n5. Test Approach\n\n5.1 Testing Levels\n\nUnit testing. This level focuses on individual components of code with isolated test environment (only for the function or code) and usually performed by developers. \n\nAPI testing. This level focuses on API to ensure it returns the correct response for various input and handle error conditions appropriately\n\nIntegration testing. This level focuses on interaction between integrated system/components of software to validate data exchanges between system. Mostly back-end and front end or back-end and database.\n\nUser Acceptance Testing (UAT).

Usability testing will be conducted by gathering 50 or more participants of driver mobile app user, by using maze. The test will begin with the question about the participant background (new employee or not, and how long the participant has been working as our driver. Then the participant will be tested with several scenario to update order with/without encountered error scenario. Then the result would be automatically calculated and displayed in result tab in maze platform.  The regression test will be using katalon for mobile test and katalon ops for cloud regression test. \n\n11.3 Defect Tracking\n\nThe process of managing bugs/defects will happen on JIRA. When reporting, we will create a card consisting title, description, severity, priority, status, attachment, assignee, and tester assignee. The defect has following life cycle:\n\nIdentification – First encounter and troubleshooting\n\nReporting – creating card in JIRA and communicating with team\n\nPrioritization – assigning priority level\n\nAssignment – after discussing the bugs with responsible developer, try to assign the developer (could be new or responsible developer) and tester.\n\nFixing – Developer working to fix defect/bug\n\nVerification/testing – After done fixing, QA starts reproduce the bug/defect\n\nDeploying hotfix – After passed the verification, hotfix deployed\n\nClosure – closing the card in JIRA\n\n12. Approval and Sign-off\n\nThere is following approval and sign-off process for this document, which consist:\n\nDraft review. Reviewing draft will be presented to stakeholders including PM, Developers, and QA team (all parties).\n\nRevision (if there is any). Changing and adjusting current draft to be aligned with stakeholders and our team needs and suggested coverage.  \n\nFinal review. Stakeholders will review the final draft and after approved, the testing will be started soon.\n\nApproval signature. All of stakeholders approve the test plans, which means they agree with scope, objectives, test approach, deliverables, and every plan inside the document.\n\n2"

Test Items\nFollowing items will be tested based on existing version of software:\nReal-time notification system\nDelivery order distribution\nMobile App: delivery process\nLegacy feature for regression testing\n3. Feature to be tested\nFollowing test items will be tested based on PRD, with additional regression test to ensure existing feature functionality, performance test, and usability testing for user experience.\nFeature functionality specific test (Based on PRD):\nUpdate delivery order list by driver via mobile app\nTest verifies that driver can update order list via mobile app and see updated order list without waiting for confirmation or delay.\n\nNotification received by warehouse management system from driver mobile app\nTest verifies that warehouse management system can receive notification of updated list.\n\nDelivery confirmation on updated order list\nTest verifies that driver can send an accurate confirmation data to warehouse management system after updating order list via mobile app.\n\nEnd-to-end test with update order list feature\nTest verifies that driver can execute usual business flow by using new drag-and-drop feature to update order list.\n\nRegression test:\nDistribution of order list created by analyst via back end to driver mobile app\nEnsuring the analyst could send order list to driver app via back-end system.\n\nNotification received by warehouse management system from driver mobile app\nEnsuring warehouse management system receive notification from driver app when driver update the order list and confirming completed delivery.\n\nList of original delivery order inside driver mobile app\nEnsuring driver can see original order list sent by analyst.\n\nDelivery confirmation on updated order list\nEnsuring driver can confirm completed delivery on updated order list.\n\nDelivery confirmation on original order list from analyst\nEnsuring the driver can confirm completed delivery on original order list from analyst\n\n\nEnd-to-end test without update order list feature\nEnsuring the system and both user (analyst and driver) can do usual business flow without using new drag-and-drop feature to update order list.\n\nEnd-to-end test with update order list feature\nEnsuring the system and both user (analyst and driver) can do usual business flow with using new drag-and-drop feature to update order list.\n\nUsability test:\nDrag-and-drop feature ease of use on driver mobile app\nEvaluates how intuitive and user-friendly the feature on mobile app for various driver age (assumption that age influence the tech savviness)\n\nUI feedback for updating the order list and error handling\nEvaluates how communicative the UI when giving feedback to driver after updating the order list and handling error (e.g signal lost after drag-and-drop) \n\nError recovery \nEvaluates how effective the UI and system to be recovered from user mistakes (e.g accidental drag-and-drop)\n4. Features Not to be Tested\nSome legacy features will not be tested by user and manual QA engineer, such as:\nLogin\nCreate order by analyst\nSorting stops for order list by analyst\nBack-end related test (no details provided in the requirement document)\nThese features will not interfere with the new feature, however these features will consist inside regression testing in end-to-end test.  Back end related test also not going to be executed since the requirement document didn’t specifies any of back-end systems, so we are working on assumption that the back-end working well or covered by other team.\n5. Test Approach\n5.1 Testing Levels\nUnit testing. This level focuses on individual components of code with isolated test environment (only for the function or code) and usually performed by developers. \nAPI testing. This level focuses on API to ensure it returns the correct response for various input and handle error conditions appropriately\nIntegration testing. This level focuses on interaction between integrated system/components of software to validate data exchanges between system. Mostly back-end and front end or back-end and database.\nUser Acceptance Testing (UAT). Conducted by end user to validate software against requirement document/business requirements to ensure it meets the needs of user as a last step of testing before deployment. \n5.2 Testing Types\nFunctional Testing. Ensuring the software works as expected and aligned with product requirement document. \nUsability Testing. Assessing user experience on UI design of new-feature. How intuitive, and user-friendly the design is. \n5.3 Test Environment\nEnvironment used in testing:\nStaging\nSandbox (environment with production server duplicate data)\nProduction\nTools used in testing:\nPostman \nSwagger\nAndroid/iOS emulator\nJIRA\nSelenium/Katalon/Robot framework (regression testing)\nMaze.co (usability test/UX)\n\n5.4 Test Methodologies\nManual testing will be conducted on following test:\nFunctional testing. Involves WMS notification system, driver drag-and-drop feature, and delivery confirmation feature by using gherkin language for test cases creation\nUsability testing.  Involves drag-and-drop ease of use, how user interact with new feature without tutorial, and how the user satisfied with UI feedback when facing error.\nUAT testing. Ensuring all requirements are met and user satisfied with the result\nAutomated testing will be conducted on following test types:\nFunctional regression test. Involves functional regression testing with legacy and new-feature before release, with end-to-end test. \n6. Test Criteria\n6.1 Functional Test Pass Criteria\nDriver can update order list after receiving order list from analyst\nDriver can confirm updated order list \nDriver can’t update order list if the card were dropped outside the order list zone\nDriver can’t update completed order card position\nDriver can’t update if the card were dropped in the same position\nAnalyst can receive and view updated order list notification in WMS from backend system\nAnalyst can receive and view order confirmation notification in WMS from backend system with real-time timestamp and total completed deliveries.\nAPI system can receive and store request data \nBackend system successfully send webhooks to WMS API\n6.2 Usability Test Pass criteria\n80% user or more, can complete tasks without tutorial\nBelow 5% of users are encountered error to do given task\n80% user or more, can recover from error without assistance\n80% user or more agree they have clear feedback and satisfied with UI design\n6.3 UAT Test Pass criteria\nAll requirements are met by system\nUser satisfied with result\n\n6.4 Exit Criteria\nThe exit criteria for this test plan is when all test criteria have been passed.\n7. Test Deliverables\nFollowing deliverables will be available at the end of test:\nTest plan\nTest cases\nTest scripts\nDefect documentation\nTest report\nUAT result\n8. Testing Schedule\nDummy schedule.\n9. Roles and Responsibilities\nSultan with full responsibilities to test all feature\n10. Risks and Contingencies\nThere are following risks with their mitigation:\nIncomplete requirement. Engage stakeholders in development process to clarify the problem\nResource Constraint. Planning resource allocation and discussing with team for alternatives.\nChanging requirement. Updating test plan, test cases, and all test related document. Re-test all test cases.\nFailed user adaptation of new feature. Creating training or tutorial for new feature.\n11. Test Management\n11.1 Test Case Design\nTest case design will be made using gherkin language and excel for documentation. All of test cases will be imported to test rail for archive. The header of excel consist test-id, test title, pre-condition, steps, expected result, actual result, test priority, and tester name. There are 3 test cases, with following cases.\n11.1.1 API test case (for notification)\n\n11.1.2 WMS (notification)\n\n11.1.3 Mobile app (drag-and-drop feature)\n\n11.1.4 Regression test scripts\nFollowing legacy features will be tested:\nLogin\nOrder creation by analyst\nStops sorting for order creation\nOrder distribution to driver\nReceiving order on driver mobile app\nDelivery confirmation feature on driver mobile app\nDelivery confirmation notification on WMS\nEnd-to-end usual business flow\n11.2 Test Execution\nThe manual test cases will be managed in test rail, but first we will use excel before importing it to test rail for documentation and archive with their respective graph. Usability testing will be conducted by gathering 50 or more participants of driver mobile app user, by using maze. The test will begin with the question about the participant background (new employee or not, and how long the participant has been working as our driver. Then the participant will be tested with several scenario to update order with/without encountered error scenario. Then the result would be automatically calculated and displayed in result tab in maze platform.  The regression test will be using katalon for mobile test and katalon ops for cloud regression test. \n11.3 Defect Tracking\nThe process of managing bugs/defects will happen on JIRA. When reporting, we will create a card consisting title, description, severity, priority, status, attachment, assignee, and tester assignee. The defect has following life cycle:\nIdentification – First encounter and troubleshooting\nReporting – creating card in JIRA and communicating with team\nPrioritization – assigning priority level\nAssignment – after discussing the bugs with responsible developer, try to assign the developer (could be new or responsible developer) and tester.\nFixing – Developer working to fix defect/bug\nVerification/testing – After done fixing, QA starts reproduce the bug/defect\nDeploying hotfix – After passed the verification, hotfix deployed\nClosure – closing the card in JIRA\n12. Approval and Sign-off\nThere is following approval and sign-off process for this document, which consist:\nDraft review. Reviewing draft will be presented to stakeholders including PM, Developers, and QA team (all parties).\nRevision (if there is any). Changing and adjusting current draft to be aligned with stakeholders and our team needs and suggested coverage.  \nFinal review. Stakeholders will review the final draft and after approved, the testing will be started soon.\nApproval signature. All of stakeholders approve the test plans, which means they agree with scope, objectives, test approach, deliverables, and every plan inside the document."
